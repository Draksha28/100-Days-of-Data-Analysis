## Lesson 1:- Reading Data Into Excel

**Common methods of reading data into Excel:-**  

- Namely, when the data is presented as a regular Excel file or it is presented as a text file, where the text is delimited either by a comma, a tab or a space. 
- Reading an excel file is easy so... 
      - Let us read the data into Excel when the data is presented in a text format.
- A text format which is a comma separated format.
- The name, comma separated text format.
- As we select the file,Excel guides us through its Text Import Wizard.
- And we need to choose the delimited option, because we are reading a delimited file. So we choose delimited option, do a Next.
- And in particular, among the options of delimiters, since this file is comma separated or comma delimited, we choose the comma as a delimiter.
- Then do a Next.And then do a Finish.
- Similarly we choose Tab as a delimiter for text file with tab as delimiter.And similarly goes with fixed width option as well.  

## Lesson 2:- Basic Data Manipulation In Excel

    2. To select the complete data in Excel: Shortcut key:- Ctrl+Shift+Side Arrow/Down Arrow
