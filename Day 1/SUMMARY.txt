And we have three different choices for our Y. We can choose a certain target value, or we can choose a maximum or a minimum.
- And in addition, we can subject our X variables to certain constraints. For example, that they need to be positive or they need to be between zero and one, and so on.
- We also can use Solver when we have functions of more than one variable.
