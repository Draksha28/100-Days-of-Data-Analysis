Initiating and Planning Projects

What is a project?
- A unique and temporary endeavour.
- Has a defined Beginning and End.
- It's purpose is to create a specific product or service or change a specific product.

Constraint: A factor which may place limitations on: What, How and When you do it.

Project Management Body of Knowledge:
- It's a guide provided by PMI(Project Management Institute)
- It provides a guide on Standardized knowledge areas and processes used to manage projects from start to finish.

Functional Organization: It includes Chief Executive -> Functional Managers(A person who has responsibility over a specific area, and does not typically run projects)-> Staff
- They work well for groups who do not run many projects and there is no complicated or tight deadline.

Matrix Organisations: They work very well when team members are assigned to multiple projects and other work.And the project manager will most likely run multiple projects.
Three types of Matrix Organizations: 
- Weak 
 i. functional Manager is in charge.
 ii. He/she assists the project coordinator
 iii. Coordinator helps maintain the schedule and status, but does not have decision-making responsibility
- Balanced 
 i. Project Manager will help ensure project success
 ii. Project Manager has some decision-making responsibilities
 iii. Project Manager manages the team to stay within scope, schedule and budget
- Strong
    Project Manager has more authority and responsibility, but not complete authority.

Projectized Organization: Project Manager is a king/queen and he acts as the manager of the team.The team works on one project. They may even write performance appraisals.

Project Stakeholder: An individual,group,or organization may affect, be affected by,or percieve itself to be 
affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.

How to identify Stakeholders for a Project?
- Who asked for this project?
- Who will use the product or service we are creating or enhancing?
- Who will have to change the way they do their jobs because of this project?
- Who makes decisions about this project?
- Who has the ability to give or take away resources from the project?
- Who influences those who make decisions about this project?
- How do you know which stakeholders need more of your attention?
- Which stakeholders will drive project success?

Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix:

Stakeholder Register: Contains the key information about your stakeholders. 
The register provides the information necessary to plan ways to engage your stakeholders.It should include items such as:
- Assessment Information
- Identification Information
- Stakeholder Classification

Immediately after project is selected we have to make a Project Charter.
Project Charter:-
-The document that formally announces the projects and grants the project manager the authority to use 
organizational resources to meet project objectives.
-The Project Charter will help you and your stakeholders gain an understanding of what the project looks like.
- Serves as an announcement which states that the project has been approved.
- States that you have been authorized to run the project and describes what you are authorized to do.

How do we get to write the Charter:
- A Business Case/Project Proposal will help you identify your stakeholders.
- Interview stakeholders at the start of project to gather information.
