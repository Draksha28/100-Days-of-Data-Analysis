## Lesson 1:- Reading Data Into Excel

**Common methods of reading data into Excel:-**  

- Namely, when the data is presented as a regular Excel file or it is presented as a text file, where the text is delimited either by a comma, a tab or a space. 
- Reading an excel file is easy so... 
      - Let us read the data into Excel when the data is presented in a text format.
- A text format which is a comma separated format.
- The name, comma separated text format.
- As we select the file,Excel guides us through its Text Import Wizard.(Sometimes we may face difficulties to convert...at that moment we can convert the text file into CSV file thus converting into EXCEL FILE) 
- And we need to choose the delimited option, because we are reading a delimited file. So we choose delimited option, do a Next.
- And in particular, among the options of delimiters, since this file is comma separated or comma delimited, we choose the comma as a delimiter.
- Then do a Next.And then do a Finish.
- Similarly we choose Tab as a delimiter for text file with tab as delimiter.And similarly goes with fixed width option as well.  

## Lesson 2:- Basic Data Manipulation In Excel
   
    1. To get to the end of a column with loads of data: Shortcut key:- Ctrl+Down Arrow
    2. To select the complete data in Excel: Shortcut key:- Ctrl+Shift+Side Arrow/Down Arrow
    3. To round off numbers...select the coumn,you right click, format cells, number, decimal place is two decimal places and okay.
    4. To sort data...Data Tab and Sort Function...We can add levels based on how many criterias we need to sort and get output of our choice.
        If data has headers, I need to make sure that the box that says my data has headers needs to be checked, and I press okay then.
    5. We can as well hide/unhide colums by right clicking selecting the columns.

## Lesson 3:- Arithmetic Manipulation In Excel

## Lesson 4:- Basic Function In Excel
    
     Freezing of Rows/Columns->  View Tab;
     Using SUM & SUMIF Functions; To select the column for Sum: Shortcut key:- Ctrl+Alt+Upper/Lower Arrow
     SUM:-  =1+2;   =SUM(A1,A2);  =SUM(1,2);  =SUM(A1:A2);

## Lesson 5:- Functions Using Absolute And Relative References
   
      Absolute Reference....and Relative Reference(Using $) to not change values when we copy paste the formula...
      MAX,MIN,COUNT,COUNTIF,POWER Functions...how to use them were clear by now.
