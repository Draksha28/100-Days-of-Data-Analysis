##  For question 7, you need to display the count of each of the order quantities (from 1 to 50). First, put "Order Quantity" under Rows. This lists out all of the order quantities. Then, put "Count of Order Quantity" under Values. This tells you how many of each order quantity appears in the data. Finally, put "Customer Segment" under Filters, and then filter by the "Corporate" segment. Now look for the row with the highest value of Count of Order Quantity.

For question 8, you need to count the orders that were ordered and shipped during each combination of quarters. In your pivot table, put "Order Date" under Columns and "Ship Date" under Rows or vice versa. Then, for both the row and column labels, right-click --> select "Group..." --> highlight "Quarters" and "Years" --> "OK". Now the dates will be grouped by quarter. Now simply put "Count of Unique ID" (or a Count of any of the fields) under Values. Your pivot table should now show the number of orders that were ordered and shipped for each combination of quarter pairs. Most of the orders were made and shipped in the same quarter, but some were not.
