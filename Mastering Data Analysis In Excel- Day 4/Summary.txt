 ## ** Linear Regression ** ##

## * Introduction to Parametric Models * ##

- Gaussian probability density function - It is by far the most common model for uncertainty used in data analysis.

 ## ** Introduction To Standardization ** ##

- Mean = Sum of all values(Outcomes) ; 
Variance(s^2) = The sum of the squared distances of each term in the distribution from the mean (µ), divided by the number of terms in the distribution (N). You take the sum of the squares of the terms in the distribution, and divide by the number of terms in the distribution (N);
Standard Deviation (s) =  Square-Root of Variance ;
- To calculate Z-Scores for X (Standardization) ; 
 Step 1:- Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of the given data;
 Step 2 :- Subtract each value with Mean; 
 Step 3 :- Divide each value we got in Step 2; with Standard Deviation;
We get the Z- Score values(Remember to round-off to 2 decimal places)
- For the Z-Scores set we get ; Mean (Xz) = 0 and Standard Deviation (Xz) = 1
 Z-Score (Xz(i)) = Xi - µx / sx 
- Note: Correlation is unchanged with standardization.	
 The slope of the standardized regression line equals the correlation.	
 The covariance equals the correlation.	

## ** Standard Normal Probability Distribution(Gaussian Distribution) In Excel ** ##

- The curve-shape is a gaussian(Continuous Distribution).
- Its standard because, its area equals 1; Mean equals 0; Standard Deviation equals 1.
- The curve is generated by a function, which is a normalizing constant that gives value of each point on the curve.
- Area under the curve is called "Cumulative Probability Distribution" 
     F(x) = 1/v2p e^-(x^2/2)  [or] F(x) = 1/v2p ?e^-(x^2/2) dx
- NORMSDIST takes as its input a, z-score, and it outputs the cumulative probability(Gives area of left of that point).
- NORMSINV, inputs a probability.
- This distribution is called "Probability Distribution Function" (which formes PDF)
      Formula to represent :- Ø(Mean,Variance)

## ** Central Limit Theorem ** ##

- The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean µ and standard deviation s and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement:-
  (i)  The mean of our sample means will approach the mean of the original distribution.
  (ii)  The standard deviation of sample means will approach the value that is equal to the standard deviation of the original distribution divided by the square root of no. of samples taken.
  (iii) Even though the original distribution has a different shape, the histogram of sample means forms an approximate Gaussian distribution 

## ** Algebra with Gaussians ** ##

- I attached a word and an excel document which explains these concepts in detail.

## ** Markowitz Portfolio Optimization ** ##

- I attached a Excel Sheet explaining this concept. 
It is a portfolio optimization model; it assists in the selection of the most efficient portfolio by analyzing various possible portfolios of the given securities.
Knowing a company's Expected Return; Risk-free Returns and Standardization...there are ways explained in the doc. how to analyse and compare different aspects required for the growth of the company.

## * Unpacking Linear Regression * ##
 
## ** Standardizing X and Y values for Linear Regression ** ##

- When ordered pairs are converted into Z-Scores:

(i) The correlation R and Coefficient of Determination (R^2) are unchanged.

(ii) The new covariance and the slope (beta)  both change to equal the correlation.

(iii) The new Y-intercept (alpha) always changes to 0.

## ** Standardization Simplifies Linear Regression ** ##

- Covariance equals R times the standard deviation of x; Times the standard deviation of y.
